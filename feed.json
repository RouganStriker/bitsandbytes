I had a few criteria in mind while looking evaluating potential tools. Having brought a web hosting service and setup my own website in the past, I know there is a very good chance I won't actually commit to maintaining this blog and writing up a weekly blog post so I was looking for a platform that required little to no cost and investment to use. The default look and feel had to be modern enough for my liking as well. Although I do web development for a living and could restyling things to my liking, that would be work and I would prefer not to do work for a hobby project.</p>\n<p>Publii was the first tool that stood out to me that met those criteria. It offered a desktop app for managing the website content and supports a Github Pages deployment (free version control!). It's slick and simple which is exactly what I want.</p>\n<p>But let's see how that opinion holds up in the far future.</p>",
